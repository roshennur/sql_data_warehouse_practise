/*

Product Report

Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
    2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
    3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
       - total orders
       - total sales
       - total quantity sold
       - total customers (unique)
       - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
       - recency (months since last sale)
       - average order revenue (AOR)
       - average monthly revenue
